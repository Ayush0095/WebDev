                         <p>Cricket is a <a href=" https://www.amazon.in/s?k=bat&crid=2GSQB39S1QR15&sprefix=bat%2Caps%2C265&ref=nb_sb_noss_1">bat</a>-and-<a href="https://www.amazon.in/s?k=cricket+ball&crid=1ZL4NCC02EW21&sprefix=cricket+ball%2Caps%2C232&ref=nb_sb_noss_1">ball</a> game played between two teams of eleven players on a field at the centre of which is a 22-yard (20-metre) pitch with <a href="https://www.amazon.in/s?k=stumps&crid=3UZNUXM5FTLXF&sprefix=stumps%2Caps%2C254&ref=nb_sb_noss_1">wickets</a> at each end, each comprising two bails balanced on three stumps.
                                 The batting side scores runs by striking the ball bowled at one of the wickets with the bat and then running between the wickets, while the bowling and fielding side tries to prevent this (by preventing the ball from leaving the field, and getting the ball to either wicket) and dismiss each batter (so they are "out"). Means of dismissal include being bowled, when the ball hits the stumps and dislodges the bails, and by the fielding side either catching the ball after it is hit by the bat, but before it hits the ground, or hitting a wicket with the ball before a batter can cross the crease in front of the wicket. When ten batters have been dismissed, the innings ends and the teams swap roles. The game is adjudicated by two umpires, aided by a third umpire and match referee in international matches. They communicate with two off-field scorers who record the match's statistical information.
                                Forms of cricket range from Twenty20 (also known as T20), with each team batting for a single innings of 20 overs (each "over" being a set of 6 fair opportunities for the batting team to score) and the game generally lasting three to four hours, to Test matches played over five days. Traditionally cricketers play in all-white kit, but in limited overs cricket they wear club or team colours. In addition to the basic kit, some players wear protective gear to prevent injury caused by the ball, which is a hard, solid spheroid made of compressed leather with a slightly raised sewn seam enclosing a cork core layered with tightly wound string.
                                The earliest reference to cricket is in South East England in the mid-16th century. It spread globally with the expansion of the British Empire, with the first international matches in the second half of the 19th century. The game's governing body is the International Cricket Council (ICC), which has over 100 members, twelve of which are full members who play Test matches. The game's rules, the Laws of Cricket, are maintained by Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC) in London. The sport is followed primarily in South Asia, Australia, New Zealand, the United Kingdom, Southern Africa and the West Indies.[1]

                                <h2><center>HISTORY</center></h2>
                                <p>Cricket is one of many games in the "club ball" sphere that basically involve hitting a ball with a hand-held implement; others include baseball (which shares many similarities with cricket, both belonging in the more specific bat-and-ball games category), <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golf">golf</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hockey">hockey</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Badminton">badminton</a> . In cricket's case, a key difference is the existence of a solid target structure, the wicket (originally, it is thought, a "wicket gate" through which sheep were herded), that the batter must defend.[4] The cricket historian Harry Altham identified three "groups" of "club ball" games: the "hockey group", in which the ball is driven to and from between two targets (the goals); the "golf group", in which the ball is driven towards an undefended target (the hole); and the "cricket group", in which "the ball is aimed at a mark (the wicket) and driven away from it".[5]</p>
                                <p>It is generally believed that cricket originated as a children's game in the south-eastern counties of England, sometime during the medieval period. Although there are claims for prior dates, the earliest definite reference to cricket being played comes from evidence given at a court case in Guildford in January 1597 (Old Style, equating to January 1598 in the modern calendar). The case concerned ownership of a certain plot of land and the court heard the testimony of a 59-year-old coroner, John Derrick, who gave witness that.</p>

                        <h4>World Series Cricket</h4>
                        <p>The money problems of top cricketers were also the root cause of another cricketing crisis that arose in 1977
                                 when the Australian media magnate <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kerry_Packer">Kerry Packer</a> fell out with the Australian Cricket Board over TV rights.
                                  Taking advantage of the low remuneration paid to players, Packer retaliated by signing several of the best 
                                  players in the world to a privately run cricket league outside the structure of international cricket. 
                                  World Series Cricket hired some of the banned South African players and allowed them to show off their 
                                  skills in an international arena against other world-class players. The schism lasted only until 1979 
                                  and the "rebel" players were allowed back into established international cricket, though many found that 
                                  their national teams had moved on without them.
                         Long-term results of World Series Cricket have included the introduction of significantly higher player 
                         salaries and innovations such as coloured kit and night games.</p>
