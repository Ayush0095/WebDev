        <h1>Overview</h1>
<p>The story begins on a dusty battlefield in ancient India.
 Arjuna, the famed archer and greatest warrior of his time, 
 is poised to fight the evil enemy who have unjustly captured 
 his kingdom using treachery and deceit and have unleashed a 
 reign of terror, cruelty and tyranny on the citizens.</p>

<h2>Poised</h2>
<p> for the biggest battle of his life with the hopes of millions
 of people resting on him to lead them to victory in a war for justice, 
 the great hero Arjuna suddenly reels and begins to falter and tremble.</p>
 <p>The real magnitude of the situation and ghastly consequences of
     impending war hit him with full force.
To fight for justice, Arjuna will have to likely kill all these men,
many if not most of whom are his friends,
teachers, and kin who were and still are very near and dear to him.
Arjuna is completely confused, overwhelmed, in denial and paralysed.
To escape the situation, he ponders giving it all up to go
 live his life as a recluse in a forest.

It is at this moment that Krishna – The Cosmic Consciousness, the Supersoul, 
the Supreme Personality of Godhead,
who had so far been acting as Arjuna’s friend and charioteer reveals His true identity.
 He leads Arjuna through a discussion of the karma, jnana and bhakti yogas,
 revealing the nature of divinity, humankind’s ultimate destiny,
 and the purpose of mortal life.</p>
