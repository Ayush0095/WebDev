A car or automobile is a motor vehicle with wheels. Most definitions of 
cars say that they run primarily on roads, seat one to eight people, have 
four wheels, and mainly transport people (rather than goods).<sup><a href="www.google.com">[1][2]</a></sup></p>

<p>Cars were invented in 1886, when German inventor Carl Benz patented his
 Benz Patent-Motorwagen.<sup><a href="www.google.com">[3][4][5]</a></sup>Cars became widely available during the
  20th century. One of the first cars affordable by the masses was the 1908
   Model T, an American car manufactured by the Ford Motor Company. Cars were 
   rapidly adopted in the US, where they replaced horse-drawn carriages.[6]
    In Europe and other parts of the world, demand for automobiles did not
     increase until after World War II.[7] The car is considered an essential part of the developed economy.

Cars have controls for driving, parking, passenger comfort, and a variety of 
lights. Over the decades, additional features and controls have been added to
 vehicles, making them progressively more complex. These include rear-reversing 
 cameras, air conditioning, navigation systems, and in-car entertainment.
  Most cars in use in the early 2020s are propelled by an internal combustion engine,
   fuelled by the combustion of fossil fuels. Electric cars, which were invented early 
   in the history of the car, became commercially available in the 2000s and are predicted
    to cost less to buy than gasoline cars before 2025.[8][9] The transition from fossil 
    fuels to electric cars features prominently in most climate change mitigation scenar
    
    ios,[10] such as Project Drawdown's 100 actionable solutions for climate change.[11]</p>

<h2>Uses of Cars</h2>
<p>There are costs and benefits to car use. The costs to the individual include acquiring
 the vehicle, interest payments (if the car is financed), repairs and maintenance, fuel
 , depreciation, driving time, parking fees, taxes, and insurance.[12] The costs to society 
 include maintaining roads, land use, road congestion, air pollution, noise pollution,
  public health and disposing of the vehicle at the end of its life. Traffic collisions
   are the largest cause of injury-related deaths worldwide.[13] Personal benefits include
    on-demand transportation, mobility, independence, and convenience.</p>
 
    [14] Societal benefits 
    include economic benefits, such as job and wealth creation from the automotive industry,
    transportation provision, societal well-being from leisure and travel opportunities, and 
    revenue generation from taxes. People's ability to move flexibly from place to place
     has far-reaching implications for the nature of societies.[15]

<footer>There are around one billion cars in use worldwide. Car usage is increasing rapidly,
 especially in China, India, and other newly industrialized countries.[16]</p>
